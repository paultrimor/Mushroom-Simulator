## To-do List 

1. Recreate Conway's Game of Life in the Mycellium Class -> ground_grid
2. Finalize the DNA Class.  
	* What does each float variable mean? 
	* Is information passed from spore -> Mycellium -> Fruit -> Spore
	* How is the DNA color represented in the Ground Grid? 
3. Create a GENE table to better understand what is going on!
